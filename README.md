#Summary 
This visualization shows the evolution of <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/">Ebola</a> 
cases in West Africa from August 2014 to May 2015 as reported by the WHO. 
<br>
The user can select an indicator and a date to see the status on the map.
He can also chosse to replay the animation for the choosen indicator.

#Design
I choosed to show the affected country on a map whith the orange colour
differentiating them for the others. Only the affected countries are
named to let the user focus on them.<br>
 A red circle is used to show the value of an indicator for each country.
I choosed a logarithmic scale for the radius of the circles so that 
the values of countries with just few cases can be seen on the map.

####Changes from v1.0

* Added a line chart with an animated red circle to show the 
total number of cases changing over time
* Increased the radius of circles
* Shows only circles that have at least on case at each time

####Changes from v1.1

* Fixed the date range on the line plot
* Displayed only the indicators that are still maintained
* For cumulative indicators, added an entry for dates where there is
no value, considering the value of the day before.

####Changes from v1.2

* Added pause, resume, and stop functionality

#Feedback 
* Hey, would be nice if you show the total cases number somewhere changing over time.
 Also, you could let the circles bigger. I played the animations sometimes, and 
I am still not sure if I have seen any circle in Mali.
* This looks really cool. The number of confirmed cases is good and seeing the circles grow/wane with the number of cases in each country is interesting.
However, when I select a different indicator than the initial default, the date range seems to be much shorter. That makes me a bit confused.
I'm also not sure why some countries disappear in the cumulative number of confirmed Ebola cases. Those numbers should only go up? Or did I misinterpret that? maybe you are missing some data for Nigeria/Senegal that cause those countries to disappear?
* Well, initially, I just noticed popping in of countries and spheres getting bigger and smaller. It wasn't until after the animation finished that I read the text and understood the visualization. If it is possible to pause the animation until after pressing a button that might be a possible improvement in usability. My main takeaway after reading the description and looking at the graph is that January 2015 was a relief point for with Ebola cases. I see that things maxed out and then eventually started to decline w/ a small relapse.
