#Summary 
This visualization shows the evolution of <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/">Ebola</a> 
cases in West Africa from August 2014 to May 2015 as reported by the WHO.

The user can select an indicator and a date to see the status on the map.
He can also chosse to replay the animation for the choosen indicator.

#Design
I choosed to show the affected country on a map whith the orange colour
differentiating them for the others. Only the affected countries are
named to let the user focus on them.<br>
 A red circle is use to show the value of an indicator for each country.
I choosed a logarithmic scale for the radius of the circles so that 
the values of countries with just few cases can be seen on the map.
